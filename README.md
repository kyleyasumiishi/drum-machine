## Lessons Learned

One of my primary goals for each freeCodeCamp project and set of challenges is to learn about new web development concepts and practice my programming skills.

Here are a few <em>new concepts</em> I learned and practiced by creating this React/Redux app:

- Sass variables
- HTML5 `audio` element
- Using `Array.map()` to dynamically render elements in React
- Initializing state in Redux
- Several DOM methods and properties, including `document.querySelectorAll()` and `document.getElementsByTagName()`
- Several Event methods and properties, including `event.target.id`, `event.target.className`, `event.target.tagName`, `event.target`, and `event.target.parentNode`
- NodeList object
- Creating Favicon
- Changing inline CSS conditionally based on application state
- The `:focus` CSS pseudo-class

## Technologies Used

- React
- Redux
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Node.js
