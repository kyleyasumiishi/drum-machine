# Drum Machine

I'm currently a drum machine app with React & Redux! This app will contain nine drum pad elements that will trigger an audio clip when the element is clicked. Users will also have the option to switch between multiple instruments, including drums, piano, and ukulele.

This app will be mobile responsive and designed for mobile users first, as I'll likely use this app and show it to others on my iPhone.

Some of the web development skills I hope to improve through building this app include:

- Sass
- CSS Grid
- React & Redux
- Media queries

## Lessons Learned

One of my primary goals for each freeCodeCamp project and set of challenges is to learn about new web development concepts and practice my programming skills.

Here are a few <em>new concepts</em> I learned and practiced by creating this React/Redux app:
